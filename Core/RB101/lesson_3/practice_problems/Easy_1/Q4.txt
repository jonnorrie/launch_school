Question 4
Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1) : This method will delete objects from an array at a specified index. ie, number = [1,3,4,5]
numbers.delete(1) : This method will delete objects from an array with a specified object name. ie, number = [2,3,4,5]
